          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            First of all, thanks for visiting my page and hopefully you have had a good time here:). My background is
            mostly based from sports and cycling that the pictures probably tells you. I love training and watching
            sports and documentarys in my free time. The reason i went into programming was that i want i dynamic
            everyday job that fits my personality and what i come from. I spent the years from the start of high school
            to i was 21 years as a competative cycling. After that carrer ended i went straight into managing a team
            with staff and some riders. That is where my experience in working in teams and around a lot of diffrent
            personalities comes from and i love that. Working towards a common goal and achiving it in the end is a
            really great feeling. My thought is achiving something as a group or together with someone is way more
            rewarding then doing something alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            I did the sports management job for 6 years from i was 21-27 when the team folded. After that i started
            working in a sports retail shop which i still do now while studying front end development. The reason i got
            into programming was that a colleage from there was studying programming and he told me some about it, even
            thought he didn`t do frontend programming. I figured i`d be cool to learn and get into. It is hard at times,
            but those persevere becomes great at the end normally so i hope that is the case for me also:).

          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>
            As in the background a mentioned a little bit of where i come from so figured i`d describe my personality
            here. Even thought this is a describtion of me by myself it might be a bit odd. Just give me a call or send
            a e-mail if you want to do a face to face meeting instead. I`d describe myself as a front on guy that speaks
            his mind and also gives positive feedback to others if they do something good. To appreciate the people
            around you and help them to perform at their best is something i find rewarding and gives good results. The
            reason i think programming fits me is that im a good that likes a dynamic everyday and not showing up and
            doing the same thing over and over. Through the studies i find it even though if i work on the same project
            for a month everyday is a little bit diffrent, which i find reward. I am a overall pretty happy guy i think
            and i love traveling and seeing news places:).
          </p>
          <p>
            I really like being around people and find it interesting to hear what they are about. I like a fast paced
            everyday life and going after it. I am a bigger fan of meeting people face to face and having a conversation
            then have them make a assesment of me in real life then through a text, so give me a call or a e-mail if you
            want to meetup for a talk:). Hopefully some info about me was a good read for you though:).
